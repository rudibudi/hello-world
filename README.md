# Simple Todo App

A lightweight client-side todo list built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tasks are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so they remain available between visits on the same device.

## Features

- Add tasks with a quick input form
- Mark tasks as completed or delete them
- Filter tasks by all, active, or completed
- Clear all completed tasks at once
- Responsive layout with a polished, accessible design

## Getting Started

2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

No build step is required. All functionality runs entirely in the browser.
